            <p>The Internet is an increasingly important part of everyday life for people around the world. But if you've never used the Internet before,
             all of this new information might feel a bit confusing at first.
             Throughout this tutoril, we'll try to answer some basic questions you may have about the Internet and how it's used.
             When you're done, you'll have a good understanding of how the Internet works, 
             how to connect to the Internet, and how to browse the Web.</p>
             
             <h3>What is the Web?</h3>
             
             <p>
                The World Wide Web—usually called the Web for short—is a collection of different websites you can access 
                through the Internet. A website is made up of related text, images, and other resources. 
                Websites can resemble other forms of media—like newspaper articles or television programs—or
                 they can be interactive in a way that's unique to computers.The purpose of a website can be almost anything:
                  a news platform, an advertisement, an online library, a forum for sharing images, or an educational site 
                  like us!

                <h3>How does the Internet work?</h3>
                <p>
                    At this point you may be wondering, how does the Internet work? The exact answer is pretty complicated and 
                    would take a while to explain. Instead, let's look at some of the most important things you should know.I
                    t's important to realize that the Internet is a global network of physical cables, which can include copper 
                    telephone wires, TV cables, and fiber optic cables. Even wireless connections like Wi-Fi and 3G/4G rely on these physical cables to access the Internet.When you visitwebsite, 
                    your computer sends a request over these wires to a server. 
                    A server is where websites are stored, and it works a lot like your computer's hard drive. Once the request arrives, 
                    the server retrieves the website and sends the correct data back to your computer.What's amazing is that this all happens in just a few seconds!
                </p>

                <p>Other things you can do on the Internet One of the best features of the Internet is the ability to communicate almost 
                    instantly with anyone in the world. Email is one of the oldest and most universal ways to communicate and share 
                    information on the Internet, and billions of people use it. Social media allows people to connect in a variety of 
                    ways and build communities online.</p>

                <h2>What is Cloud Computing? Everything You Need to Know</h2>
                <article>

                    <h3>What is Cloud Computing?</h3>
                    <p> <img alt="1" src="imges/3.png"></p>
                    <p>
                A few years ago, the basic concept of the cloud was derided by reducing it to the idea of “someone else’s computer,” a saying that decorates the coffee mugs of quite a few IT professionals. Oracle CTO Larry Ellison was equally skeptical, complaining that “we’ve redefined cloud computing to include everything that we already do.”

In the simplest terms, however, the definition of cloud computing is this:

A distributed digital infrastructural resource that delivers hosted services by way of the internet.

And while there are several different ways to define cloud computing, it all comes down to these five key aspects:

Networking
Data management
Storage
Services
Devices
        </p>
        <h3>Types of Cloud Deployments</h3>
            
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Type</th>
                    <th>Detials</th>
                    <th> Pro and Cons</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>1. Public Cloud</td>
                    <td>A public cloud is maintained through a third-party IaaS cloud provider. Servers, storage, and other digital resources are delivered through the internet. Since the provider absorbs all infrastructure and bandwidth costs, a customer only needs a web browser to access service and manage accounts.</td>
                        <td> Pros: Reliable service, cost-effective through economies of scale, no maintenance, elastic scalability Cons: Often deemed unsafe for handling highly private and sensitive data; must comply with strict security regulations</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2. Private Cloud</td>
                    <td>In a private cloud, cloud computing services, infrastructure, and networking are operated solely by an organization independent of other enterprises or public platforms. A private cloud can be maintained in one of two ways: A company’s data center is physically located in-house, or a third-party vendor is paid to host everything on a private instance.</td>
                    <td>Pros: More control, customizable, scalable, flexible, secure Cons: More expensive and maintenance (if kept on-site)</td>

                </tr>
                    
        </tbody>
    </table>
