            <h2>What is cloud computing?</h2>
            <p>Cloud computing is on-demand access to computing resources—physical or virtual servers,
            data storage, networking capabilities, application development tools, 
            software, AI-powered analytic platforms and more—over the internet with pay-per-use pricing.</p>

            <p> In simpler terms, the "cloud" doesn't refer to something floating in the sky. 
            Instead, when you use cloud services, you're accessing remote servers, powerful mainframe
            computers housed in large data centers, through the internet. The cloud computing model 
            gives you, the customer, greater flexibility and scalability compared to traditional 
            on-premises infrastructure.</p>
            <p>Cloud computing is pivotal in our everyday lives, whether that means to access a cloud 
                application such as Google Gmail, stream a movie on Netflix or play a cloud-hosted video game.
                With cloud computing, you get the computing power or storage you need, without having to own or manage 
                the physical hardware yourself.</p>

                        <td>The Internet is an increasingly important part of everyday life for people around the world. But if you've never used the Internet before, all of this new information might feel a bit confusing at first.

Throughout this tutorial, we'll try to answer some basic questions you may have about the Internet and how it's used. When you're done, you'll have a good understanding of how the Internet works, how to connect to the Internet, and how to browse the Web</td>
                        <td>What is the Internet?

The Internet is a global network of billions of computers and other electronic devices. With the Internet, it's possible to access almost any information, communicate with anyone else in the world, and do much more.

You can do all of this by connecting a computer to the Internet, which is also called going online. When someone says a computer is online, it's just another way of saying it's connected to the Internet.</td>
                        <td>What is the Web?

The World Wide Web—usually called the Web for short—is a collection of different websites you can access through the Internet. A website is made up of related text, images, and other resources. Websites can resemble other forms of media—like newspaper articles or television programs—or they can be interactive in a way that's unique to computers.

The purpose of a website can be almost anything: a news platform, an advertisement, an online library, a forum for sharing images, or an educational site like us!/td>
